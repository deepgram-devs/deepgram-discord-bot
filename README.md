# Node.JS TypeScript Template

This template includes my standard configuration for a Node.js and TypeScript project. The linter and formatter have been configured, as well as the GitHub Actions workflows. A testing framework has also been prepared, using Chai's `assert` API. Our standard logging configuration is also included.

## Usage

To use this template, click the "Use this template" button above. You will be prompted to enter the name of your new repository. Once you have done so, you will be redirected to your new repository.

You are welcome to extend and overwrite the configs as you desire (please do not PR your changes back to this template, these changes will be rejected).

TypeScript will read from the `src` directory and compile to a `prod` directory. The `test` directory will be ignored by the compiler, but will be linted to ensure the code follows your standards.

There is an action that will create an issue on your new repository, with a helpful checklist of the settings we typically update / change.

## Configurations

The configuration settings can be found in these repositories:

- [ESLint](https://github.com/naomi-lgbt/eslint-config)
- [Prettier](https://github.com/naomi-lgbt/prettier-config)
- [TypeScript](https://github.com/naomi-lgbt/typescript-config)

You are welcome to propose changes to the global configuration via issues on those repositories. However, the configurations are central to all of our projects, so please be prepared to justify your changes.
